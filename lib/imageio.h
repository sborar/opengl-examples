/** @file
 
Read and write numerous image file formats via ImageMagick's
MagickCore library. For a list of supported file formats, see
http://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php
 
Although GraphicsMagick is similar to ImageMagick, this code only
works with ImageMagick.
 
All functions provided by imageio.c assume that images are stored
in 1D arrays (row major order, origin at the bottom left of the
image). If you have an RGB image (i.e., a 3 component image), the
first three bytes in the array is the color of the bottom-left
corner.
 
The ImageMagick library license allows people to use the library in
code that is published under a different license than the
ImageMagick license:
